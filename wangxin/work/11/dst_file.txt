Beauty

Your lips, your eyes, your soul 
Are like a work of art, 
The most creative thing of all 
Is your beautiful heart. 

If you were a painting, 
No colours could express 
The beauty deep inside you, 
A rainbow, nothing less. 

If you were a sculpture 
The clay could hardly make 
Your figure of an angel 
Without one mistake. 

If you were a euphony 
No choir could really sing 
All the beautiful music 
Your eyes could possibly bring. 

So here I am, an artist, 
With inspiration beyond belief 
But to capture such rare beauty, 
I'd have to be a thief. 

Before I fall in love
 
my heart, says we've got something real 
can i trust the way i feel 
cause my heart's been fooled before 
am i just seeing what I want to see 
or, is it true, could you really be 
somethone to have and hold 
with my heart and soul 
i need to know, before i fall in love 
someone who'll stay around 
through all my ups and downs 
please tell me now, before i fall in love 
i'm at the point of on reture
so afraid of getting bumed 
but i want to take a change 
oh please, give me a reason to believe 
say, that you're the one, that you'll always be 
it's been so hard for me to give my heart away 
but i would give my everything ,
just to here you say
